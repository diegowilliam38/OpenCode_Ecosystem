### Plan Lifecycle
```
not-started → in-progress → complete
                         ↘ blocked
```

### Phase Lifecycle
```
[PENDING] → [IN PROGRESS] → [COMPLETE]
                         ↘ [BLOCKED]
```

### Task Lifecycle
```
[ ] unchecked → [x] checked
```

### Critical Rules

1. **Only ONE phase** may be `[IN PROGRESS]` at any time
2. **Only ONE task** may have `← CURRENT` marker at any time
3. **Move `← CURRENT`** immediately when starting a new task
4. **Mark tasks `[x]`** immediately after completing them
